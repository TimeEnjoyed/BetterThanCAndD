# 2023 Codejam

## Project Description

Right now, here are the current ideas for this project:
 - dydevx
   - Twitch redeem feature that allows a user to randomly play a clip from the past for sake of nostalgia
 - Razvan
    - time management tool
    - time capsule
    - game where clip is fetched from random vod and viewers have to guess how long ago it was

## Tools/Libraries
At the moment, nothing is set in stone. However, these are the tools that might be used:
 - CMake as build system
 - libcurl or [TwitchXX](https://github.com/burannah/TwitchXX) for API requests
 - Catch2 or Google Test for unit testing
 - OBS extensions library

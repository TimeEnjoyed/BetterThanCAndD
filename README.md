# 2023 Codejam

## Project Description
Right now, here are the current ideas for this project:
 - dydevx
   - Twitch redeem feature that allows a user to randomly play a clip from the past for sake of nostalgia
 - Razvan
    - time management tool
    - time capsule
    - game where clip is fetched from random vod and viewers have to guess how long ago it was
 - turing\_earth\_boat
    - Gambling bot that can loan points for predictions. Would likely use Twitch API for predictions.
    - Word cloud that shows the N most used words

## TODOS
 - [ ] Decide on project idea. Needs to happen by Monday or we're all screwed.
 - [ ] Create a Twitch account for use of project. This inevitably brings up the issue of credential sharing, which is a pain in the neck.

## Tools/Libraries
At the moment, nothing is set in stone. However, these are the tools that might be used:
 - CMake as build system
 - libcurl or [TwitchXX](https://github.com/burannah/TwitchXX) for API requests, though TwitchXX hasn't been updated in years
 - Catch2 or Google Test for unit testing
 - OBS extensions library
